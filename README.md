In this unit, we'll be switching gears to learn jQuery and JavaScript. jQuery is a JavaScript library, and is a great way to add animations and cool effects to your website.

You're going to be tackling the lesson `jQuery Basketballers`. If you finish this, feel free to tackle any of the labs or read through the jQuery resources. If you're already familiar with jQuery, take a stab at `Advanced Lab: jQUery Selectors Practice`.

Once you've gotten the animation to work, take a screenshot and show it off to your friends with \#flatironcodeclub and \#jquerybasketballers. If you finish the lab, feel free to share with \#jquerygameshow
